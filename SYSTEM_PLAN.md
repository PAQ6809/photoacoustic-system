# Photoacoustic System Plan

This document lays out a more detailed concept and product roadmap for the **photoacoustic system** I’m building as part of my learning journey.  The goal is to design an affordable, modular system that can capture photoacoustic signals, reconstruct them into images and ultimately serve as a platform for research and education.

## System Concept and Architecture

A photoacoustic imaging system works by delivering pulsed optical energy to an object and detecting the resulting ultrasound waves.  My proposed system will have the following components:

* **Pulsed energy source** – a nanosecond laser (or high‑powered LED) that generates short bursts of light.  Energy is delivered via optical fibers or mirrors【587532699228216†L287-L295】.
* **Optical delivery path** – fiber couplers, collimators and mirrors directing the light to the target.
* **Sample or phantom** – tissue or other materials that will absorb the energy and produce acoustic waves.
* **Acoustic detector** – a single‑element or array ultrasound transducer that captures the generated sound waves【587532699228216†L287-L295】.
* **Front‑end electronics** – pre‑amplifiers and filters to condition the received signal.
* **Data acquisition** – an analog‑to‑digital converter (ADC) or microcontroller to digitize signals and stream them to the host computer.
* **Processing software** – Python code that performs signal conditioning, beamforming and image reconstruction【587532699228216†L287-L315】.
* **User interface** – scripts to visualize the raw signals and reconstructed images.

## Hardware Plan

| Component | Options & Rationale |
|----------|--------------------|
| **Laser / LED** | A Q‑switched diode‑pumped solid state laser (e.g. 532 nm, 5–10 ns pulse width) or a pulsed LED.  The pulse energy should be sufficient to generate detectable signals without exceeding tissue safety limits. |
| **Optical path** | Use fiber optics to route light into the sample.  Lens and collimators will be chosen to provide a uniform spot.  A beam splitter can enable simultaneous illumination and reference monitoring. |
| **Transducer** | Start with a single‑element broadband ultrasound transducer (e.g. 5–10 MHz).  Later, move to a linear array for faster imaging and beamforming【587532699228216†L287-L315】. |
| **Front‑end electronics** | Design a simple pre‑amplifier with configurable gain and an anti‑aliasing filter.  Off‑the‑shelf ultrasound front‑end ICs (e.g. AFE5809) are also an option. |
| **Data acquisition** | For the prototype, a USB oscilloscope or an Arduino‑style microcontroller with high‑speed ADC can be used.  For arrays, a multi‑channel ADC board or FPGA may be necessary. |
| **Control unit** | A Raspberry Pi or PC will trigger the laser, capture data and run the Python scripts. |

## Software Plan

The software will be written in Python and released under an open‑source license.  Key modules include:

1. **Signal simulation** – provide synthetic test signals like decaying sine waves (see `main.py`) to verify processing routines.
2. **Hardware drivers** – modules to control the laser/LED and read data from the ADC.
3. **Signal processing** – filtering, envelope detection, Hilbert transform and Fourier analysis.  For arrays, implement delay‑and‑sum beamforming and basic image reconstruction【587532699228216†L287-L315】.
4. **Visualization** – plot raw A‑lines, envelope signals, spectrograms and reconstructed images.
5. **Machine learning modules** – in the long term, integrate simple classifiers to automatically identify features in the data.
6. **Configuration system** – YAML/JSON files for specifying hardware parameters, sampling rates and processing options.

## Development Milestones

| Phase | Activities |
|------|-----------|
| **Research & Simulation (2025 Q4)** | Review literature on photoacoustic imaging.  Use Python to simulate decaying sine waves and noise.  Understand signal‑to‑noise requirements. |
| **Hardware Prototyping (2026 Q1‑Q2)** | Assemble the laser, transducer and data acquisition chain on a breadboard.  Test trigger synchronization. |
| **Software Development (2026 Q2‑Q3)** | Build drivers and basic signal processing pipelines.  Add support for saving data to CSV and plotting results. |
| **Array & Imaging (2026 Q3‑Q4)** | Introduce a transducer array.  Implement beamforming and simple B‑mode image reconstruction. |
| **Testing & Calibration (2026 Q4)** | Measure spatial resolution and penetration depth using phantoms.  Adjust system parameters. |
| **Patent Preparation (2026 Q4)** | Identify unique innovations (modular architecture, low‑cost integration).  Draft a provisional patent description. |

## Patent Considerations

To protect the novel aspects of this system, consider filing a **Taiwan invention patent** or **utility model**.  An invention patent requires submitting a request form, detailed specification, claims, abstract and drawings【397613980233093†L102-L116】.  The specification must be submitted in Traditional Chinese; foreign language filings require translation within four months【397613980233093†L144-L151】.  Prepare clear claims covering the modular design, affordable hardware integration and software algorithms.

## Future Directions

* Add hybrid imaging modes by integrating ultrasound or optical coherence tomography sensors【587532699228216†L330-L347】.
* Develop real‑time imaging with GPU acceleration and high repetition rate lasers.
* Explore AI‑powered reconstruction and feature detection.
* Package the system as a teaching toolkit for biomedical engineering courses.
