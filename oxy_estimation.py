"""
A simple demonstration script for estimating tissue oxygen saturation (sO₂) from
photoacoustic signal amplitudes measured at two wavelengths. The method
implemented here uses a basic ratio‐of‐ratios approach: the ratio of
photoacoustic amplitudes at two wavelengths is linearly mapped to an oxygen
saturation estimate between 0 and 1.

This script reads amplitude values from two CSV files (one for each
wavelength), computes the ratio for each sample, converts it into an sO₂
estimate, clamps the result between 0 and 1, and writes the estimated
saturation values to a new CSV file. You can adjust the calibration
parameters `r_min` and `r_max` to reflect the minimum and maximum expected
ratio values for deoxygenated and fully oxygenated tissue, respectively.

Note: This example serves as a teaching tool and starting point for
implementing more sophisticated algorithms. In real systems, calibration
should be performed using reference phantoms or blood samples to determine
appropriate mapping parameters.
