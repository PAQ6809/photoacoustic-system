# 3D Photoacoustic Imaging Overview

This document summarises common strategies for extending two‑dimensional
photoacoustic imaging to three‑dimensional volumes. It is intended to provide
conceptual guidance for designing custom 3D systems.

## Rotational and Translational Scanning

In conventional photoacoustic tomography (PAT) systems, a single‑element
ultrasound transducer can be mechanically rotated around the sample. Signals
are acquired from multiple angles either in a stop‑and‑go manner or via
continuous rotation【293528633092022†L277-L327】. Continuous scanning reduces
acquisition time compared with step‑and‑go methods【293528633092022†L318-L327】.
By reconstructing successive cross‑sectional slices as the detector or sample
is translated along the axial direction, a three‑dimensional volume can be
assembled.

## 2D Array Transducers

An alternative approach is to replace the single detector with a one‑ or
two‑dimensional array of ultrasound transducers. High‑frequency arrays (e.g.,
45 MHz 1D arrays and 70 MHz 2D arrays) have been used in photoacoustic
microscopy and tomography【293528633092022†L256-L258】. When combined with
beamforming and delay‑and‑sum reconstruction, array systems can produce
volumetric images in real time without mechanical motion.

## Scanning Stages and Motion Control

For an open‑source 3D system, a motorised translation stage or rotary table
driven by a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino or Raspberry Pi) can be integrated.
The stage moves either the sample or the detector along predefined paths
while synchronised with laser firing and data acquisition. Precise control
over motion and timing is essential to ensure that the spatial sampling
matches the desired resolution.

## Data Processing and Visualisation

Volumetric datasets require appropriate reconstruction algorithms and
visualisation tools. Filtered back projection and model‑based algorithms can
be extended to three dimensions for PAT. After reconstruction, the volume
can be viewed as individual slices, maximum intensity projections or
volume renders. Python libraries such as `scikit‑image`, `matplotlib` or
`vtk` may be used for 3D visualisation. Efficient GPU‑based implementations
can accelerate both reconstruction and rendering.

This overview is a starting point for exploring three‑dimensional
photoacoustic imaging. Further reading and experimentation will be
necessary to optimise a specific system design.
